# Deep-Learning-CNN-based-X-ray-diagnosis-of-lung-effusion
In this project, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been used to analyse chest X-ray images of patients to detect presence of "effusion". This is a classification problem, where we will be dealing with two classes - 'effusion' and 'nofinding'. Here, the latter represents a "normal" X-ray image.
